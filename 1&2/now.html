                    <h5>Current Focus & Career</h5>
                        <p>At the moment, my primary focus is on learning and growing within the field of web development. I’m currently studying a bachelor of 
                            science in computer and system sciences, specialization: Interaction Design , and taking a web development course to expand my 
                            technical skills. I'm especially interested in frontend development, where I can combine design, usability, and technology. 
                            I'm passionate about creating digital experiences that are both functional and user-friendly, and I hope to work on projects that 
                            have a real impact on people’s everyday lives.</p>

                        <p>Outside of my studies, I dedicate time to personal growth and exploring new hobbies. I have recently started learning rollerskating, and it has been an enriching 
                            experience. I also enjoy painting and working out, as it help me maintain balance and creativity in my life. 
                            Whether it's reading books, working on side projects, or spending time with loved ones, I make sure to nourish my mental and physical well-being.</p>

                            <p>In my personal life, I value deep and meaningful relationships with friends, family, and colleagues. I believe in the power of connection and 
                                spend quality time with the people who matter most to me. Right now, I’m focused on nurturing these bonds while exploring new friendships 
                                and professional networks. Social interactions play a crucial role in maintaining my happiness and perspective on life.</p>

                                becoming a IT project manager, and I am actively taking steps to achieve them. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, both in my career
                                and personal life, and I'm determined to keep pushing forward with enthusiasm and dedication.</p>
